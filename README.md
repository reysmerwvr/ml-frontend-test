## 🛠 Installation

Download zip file and extract it [latest release](https://github.com/reysmerwvr/ml-frontend-test/releases/latest). Or clone the repository and cd into it.

ML Front-End Test uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd ml-frontend-test
npm install
```

## 🚀 Running with NPM

Run the following command to start the HTTP Server.

```sh
cd ml-frontend-test
cp .env.example .env # If you don't have .env file you can use the example one. Just rename .env.example to .env. Enter your configuration here.
npm start # Run React App
npm test # Run tests
npm run storybook # Run Storybook Server
```

## 🐳 Running it with Docker

```sh
cd ml-frontend-test
cp .env.example .env # If you don't have .env file you can use the example one. Just rename .env.example to .env. Enter your configuration here.
docker-compose build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
docker-compose ps
docker-compose down -v # Bring down the development containers (and the associated volumes with the -v flag)
